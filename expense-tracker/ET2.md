### 🛠️ Python Concepts Used

- **Variables & Data Structures** – `int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, and **NumPy arrays** for efficient data handling and calculations.
- **Functions & Modular Programming** – Organize the codebase into logical functions for better readability and maintainability.
- **Conditional Logic & Loops** – Use `if-else` and `for` loops to manage user flow and process data.
- **Global Variables** – Manage application state and data shared across different functions.
- **Exception Handling** – Implement `try-except` blocks for robust input validation and error prevention.
- **Tkinter GUI Framework** – Utilize **Tkinter's advanced widgets** (e.g., Treeview, Canvas) for creating a modern and interactive interface.
- **NumPy Library** – Leverage **NumPy arrays** and its powerful mathematical functions for fast and accurate data analysis.
